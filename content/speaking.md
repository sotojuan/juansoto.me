# Speaking

**20 May 2017 / [Empire City Elixir Conference](http://empex.co)**

I spoke about functional representations of data structures and what they can teach us about solving problems and modeling our data such that it lends itself to purely functional solutions.

**20 October 2016 / [BrooklynJS](http://brooklynjs.com)**

I spoke about inclusivity in open source projects, particularly how mantainers can make it easy
for first time contributors to help out and want to continue supporting a project.

**August to November 2016 / [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com/)**

I spoke at many of the weekly Thursday presentations events. Some of the topics I talked about were Supervisors in Elixir, a monadic alternative to JavaScript Promises, and Elixir macros.

**20 July 2016 / [NYC Node](https://www.meetup.com/nodejs/events/232643352/)**

I spoke about [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), the JavaScript concurrent test runner.

          I work at <a href="https://www.capsulecares.com/">Capsule</a>.
        </p>

          Before that, I was at the <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> studying distributed functional programming in Erlang and Elixir.

<!--         <p>
          I like creating great and simple experiences for developers and users. I prefer backend work
          and writing APIs, but in general I enjoy building tech that makes people more productive.
